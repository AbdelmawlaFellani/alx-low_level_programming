## Description

Low-level programming involves working directly with computer hardware and software. It requires a good understanding of computer architecture, memory management, and other technical aspects of programming.

The projects in this repository cover a wide range of topics related to low-level programming, including:

    Data structures and algorithms
    Memory management
    Bit manipulation
    File I/O
    Shell scripting

Each project is contained in its own folder, with a README file that describes the project and its requirements.
